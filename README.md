### Who is going to use this app
The person using this app would be sitdown customer in a restaurant.  Getting close to EBD, they would like a quick and healthy idea for dinner. 

#### Example
When a person gets the check at the end of a meal and they would like to calculate how much to leave for a tip for their server, they need to do mental math.  The point of the tip calculator is to enter the bill total, choose a percentage tip they would like to leave, and the app tells them how much money that would equal.
